[Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) is my citation manager. I love it, here's why.

* It's open source
* It's lightweight
* It syncs with overleaf 
* It has excellent search
* One click to save from browser
* It syncs to the cloud
* Customizable bibliography formats 

More reasons to love:

* Lots of free storage 
* Integreations with Word, Google docs, etc
* The project folders are great for organizing research
* Automatic report generation with all your notes
* Group-libraries for collaboration
* A cute timeline generator
