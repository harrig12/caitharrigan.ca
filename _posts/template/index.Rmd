```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
```


Workflow for creating a new blog post:

1. copy template directory
2. edit title and date in `index.Rmd` of the new directory, and set `draft = false`
3. run `distill::rename_post_dir('_posts/CopyOfTemplate')` on the new folder
4. remember to knit the post before rendering site

Plans for future posts:

+ Creating a data-driven CV
+ galiwatch
+ How to find undergraduate research opportunities (at UofT)
+ How to write a reference letter for yourself
+ Grant writing advice (with samples)
  + OGS
+ How to be a computational biologist
+ Reproducibility crisis
+ Teaching toolbox
  + transplant the personal notes I've taken
+ Mentors & Sponsors
  + Mentor mapping
+ Data privacy, data ownership
  + https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/04/10/tracking-your-pregnancy-an-app-may-be-more-public-than-you-think/
