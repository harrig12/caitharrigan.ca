Workflow for creating a new blog post:

1. copy template directory
2. edit title and date in `index.Rmd` of the new directory, and set `draft = false`
3. run `distill::rename_post_dir('_posts/CopyOfTemplate')` on the new folder

Plans for future posts:

+ How to be a good grad student
+ How to find undergraduate research opportunities (at UofT)
+ How to be a computational biologist
