My parents are scientists. This means that since retiring, they've taken up their version of watching the birds in the backyard: conducting an observational study of the birds in the backyard.

They've set up a bunch of sensors, to collect air quality data, weather information, and timelapse images.

I've been helping them out with some data clean up and visualization.
