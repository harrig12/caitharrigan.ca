# General writing strategies

This is my attempt to compile what I've learned about writing though applying for government scholarships. Most of it comes from my own experience, but some I also picked up by looking at PI's grant applications for Canadian funding. 

**Take everything I say with a grain of salt**. I'm not a professional writer, and I defnitly haven't won all the awards I've ever applied to. This is really just a list of strategies that I use when writing, some of which might be helpful, some not. They are all aimed at building technical project proposals, with a bias towards NSERC because that's the agency that my work falls under. 

Additionally, keep in mind that I'm writing this at a particular moment in time. In preparing this post, I've been really surprised by how different the expectations were on student applications, just 5 years ago. I think that my writing algorithm is pertty gerneralizable (I have used it for both technical writing, and personal statements), but I can't anticipate how the requirements might change in the future. 

## Get writing advice, and peer review



## An algorithm to write to

Important: do the following things *in this order*

1. Set up page margins to 2cm
2. Set font to 12pt Arial
3. Write document title and your name in the header. Don't forget to paginate where appropriate. 
1. Paste the instructions into the document, anything that gives guidelines on what the content should be. Check back on these as you write, especially if you get stuck on what to write about.
4. Write a bullet point outline of all the ideas you want to include (past, present, future work, practical implementation, etc)
5. Write statement-style headers for each section, in a way that captures the narrative flow of the story. These headers should be written such that they are sufficient that someone reading them could explain your whole project, even though you haven't written the content yet. Put them in bold. 
6. Assign the bullet points to headers. These will guide how you flush out the body text.
7. Write the content paragraphs. Don't worry about writing them in order. If you have trouble making progress on one, write a shabby skeleton the best you can, and move on to a different section. The headers from step 5 will give you a strong sense of which chunks of text are self-contained. 
8. Edit. Go back to any paragraphs that are not flowing correctly. Use a read-aloud service (ex. MS word) to **listen** to your draft. 
9. Realize you're about 20% over the page limit. Change font to 12pt Times New Roman. Now you're done.

<aside>I am writing this in 2021. The specific formatting instructions might have changed since then. Never listen to anyone about presentation standards, except the official instructions. 

Steps 4-6 should only contain sentence fragments and ideas that are **easy to write**. Do not spend time agonizing over wording in these steps. 
</aside>

I learned #6 by reading other people's Vanier examples. Done correctly, your headers will improve the readability of your documents. This will be the thing that makes your application skimmable. This is important, because your application will be one of a large number of others that reviewers will have to read through.

Another critical trick for me is to always draft in Arial before finalizing to Times New Roman. TNR is significantly more condensed, and this font conversion will gift you extra space, as long as you don't *start* by writing in it. I tend to over-write, and this trick helps me avoid having to spend a lot of time cutting content.  
 
When it comes to getting the exact wording you want, don't let perfect be the enemy of progress. When you get stuck on a word:

* Use a thesaurus 
* Look at other writing samples (some of mine are available [here]())
*  Write down a few synonyms of the word you're trying to find as a note to self and come back to it later.


## Structure of research proposal

This is just one structure example, which I have followed with success in the past. There are many other equally effective other structuring approaches. 

There are a few points in this structure that are subtly distinct. You should not just paraphrase the same sentence twice for these, which is a pitfall I've been prone to. These elements have different roles in the proposal. I have highlighted pairs of elements in this structure should **not** get conflated. Distinguish them from each other by changing the scope of what they describe, or where they fall on a timeline spanning from "your project" to "we aquired all knowledge in the field". 

1. Background and motivation  
    a. Where we are now (state of the field)
    a. <span style="background-color:orange;">What’s needed</span> (key steps in new knowledge generation)
    
1. Objectives and hypothesis
    a. What you’re developing (one liner)
    a. <span style="background-color:lightgreen;">What it will enable</span> (big picture impact of your results) 

1. <span style="background-color:orange;">Knowledge gap</span> (The direction your results will take the field in. Keep   it large enough scale/scope that your project does not   completely fill this gap, but maybe your project, plus 3-5 years  more research would.) 

1. <span style="background-color:lightgreen;">Significance</span> (Implications of what your project will enable)

1. Experimental and theoretical approach
    a. Summary of 2-3 <span style="background-color:powderblue;">goals</span>. Goals should describe the overarching themes of what your results will show.
    a. 2-3 <span style="background-color:powderblue;">aims</span>, with substeps that build to each aim. Aims should be actionable steps you will take, and build on each other logically, however later aims should not strictly rely on the success of earlier aims in order to be possible to execute. (What would you do if the early stuff didn't work out? You don't want to leave your proposal vulnerable to that question.)

1. Why you are uniquely positioned to execute the research here and now


The biggest challenge for early-PhDs is not yet having a super strong grasp on the state of their field, and how their project fits in that context. Probably your PI has a good idea of this, and they may have an overarching research story that you can tap into. The only other thing you can do to improve on this is to read widely and engage with other researchers in your field. This is more of a student-lifestyle thing than it is writing advice, but it's what makes for a good researcher (and subsequently, research proposal).


## Use a citation management tool

If you're not already using a citation management tool, then your life is harder than it needs to be. I use [Zotero](https://zotero.org/), but many favour [Mendeley](https://www.mendeley.com), or [Paperpile](https://paperpile.com/). 

<aside> I explain all the reasons I love Zotero in [this](TODO) post.

## Start early (no, really)

As a serial procrastinator, this is the piece of advice that I always hated hearing. Obviously no one *wants* to fall into last minute panic, it just happens. 

Don't expect to nail it on the first try.

The easiest thing to work off of is your own past writing samples. You can steal full sentences from them without plagerizing, and it's always in your own words `r emo::ji('relieved')`


# OGS & CGSD specific advice

In my first year, I won OGS, and my CGSD was put on the alternate list, but I didn't win it. 

# Vanier-specific advice

Vanier is a different beast. There is a heavy emphasis on leadership, and it's gotten ridiculously competitive in recent years.

> The selection committee does not consider simply participating in sports, arts, volunteering and employment in leadership positions as demonstrating Leadership in and of themselves.

So wait, being a leader isn't leadership? Then what is? 

I interpret this statement as: just stating that you lead something is not sufficient. If you've been in a leadership position, you probably do have what they're looking for. You need to be able to speak to times that you did something extra, whether that was in a decision making capacity or a contribution you made. What would have been different if someone else were in that leadership position instead of you? What wouldn't have happened, that only you could have provided? 

<aside> Don't take "only you" too literally. What I mean by this is: what special flavour did you impart on the endeavour by being the lead. </aside>

## Create a draft that harmonizes with your reference letters

A common recipe that I have noticed in the successful applications that I've seen (and tried to model in my own application) to prove that your leadership is "above and beyond" goes along these lines:

+ You have a series of examples of times you were in a leadership position, and did something extra
  + You made the leadership position your own in some way
  + You took an active role in supporting others
  + You created something new to solve a problem
+ Between your two reference letters, all the examples you listed are repeated, but discussed from a different perspective
  + Your referees identify the impact of the "something extra" that you did
  + Your referees are able to explain why what you did made others admire/respect/be grateful to you
  + Your referees have a lot of positive adjectives to describe your character


## Have a clear idea of your career direction

+ It's not bragging to say you want to be an amazing professional. 
+ anchor the story

## Offer to draft your referee's letters for them

This will make it a lot easier for your referees to agree to be a reference for you. It will also let you have a hand in what your letters look like, and ensure that they suport your personal leadership statement. 

<aside> Bonus tip: I avoid using the phrase "reference letter" because that sounds to me like a neutral term. Your referees should absolutely **not** be neutral about you! The phrase I prefer is "endorsement letter". This sounds more positive overall, and is a good way to signal to your referees what you are asking for from them. A reference letter that is not an endorsement is not useful to you anyways. </aside>





## Leave a full day for formatting 

Do not under estimate the time sink that is uploading all your files, reuploading, editing the CCV because of a missing comma,
