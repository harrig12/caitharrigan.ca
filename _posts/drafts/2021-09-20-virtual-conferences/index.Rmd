As someone relatively new to the world of academic conferences, comparing pre-and post COVID experiences is not so easy for me. I can speak to what I was expecting, and what I found.

I think the ML field in general has been raising questions about how it runs conferences, tactics for ensuring quality peer review processes ,

-   I like OpenReview

-   I like online posters

-   I like zoom poster sessions (really!)

-   I hate zoom oral presentations
