She was patient, supportive, and skilled at explaining complicated concepts in biology and programming. As a mentor, she has a great sense of when to guide you through a problem and when to let you work through challenges on your own. She helped me grow as a researcher and writer and I’m grateful for everything I learned from her.”\n\n\n“As a mentor, Caitlin has greatly enhanced my ability to conduct research. She also provided valuable resources and aimed to make sure that I understood the fundamental concepts behind all the research conducted by breaking down difficult principles into easily comprehensible statements and thoughts. Additionally, she helped me find any sources of error as the research progressed. I enjoyed researching under her guidance, and I had an overall positive experience.”"

    "section": "",
    "text": "This is my attempt to compile what I’ve learned about writing though applying for government scholarships. Most of it comes from my own trial and error, but some I also picked up from workshops, and by looking at other people’s proposals.\nSpecial thanks to Shawn Goyal, Silvia Sellan, Amit Deshwar, Trevor Stirling, Jeff Wintersinger, Sam Killackey for helpful advice they’ve shared with me\nI’m not a trained writer, and I definitely haven’t won all the awards I’ve ever applied to. This is really just a list of strategies that I use when writing, some of which might be helpful, some not. They are all aimed at building technical project proposals, with a bias towards NSERC because that’s the agency that my work falls under.\nAdditionally, keep in mind that I’m writing this at a particular moment in time. In preparing this post, I’ve been really surprised by how different the expectations were on student applications, just 5 years ago. I think that my writing algorithm is pertty gerneralizable (I have used it for both technical writing, and personal statements), but I can’t anticipate how the requirements might change in the future.\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant: do the following things in this order\n\nSet up page margins to 2cm\nSet font to 12pt Arial\nWrite document title and your name in the header. Don’t forget to paginate where appropriate.\nPaste the instructions into the document, anything that gives guidelines on what the content should be. Check back on these as you write, especially if you get stuck on what to write about.\nWrite a bullet point outline of all the ideas you want to include (past, present, future work, practical implementation, etc)\nWrite statement-style headers for each section, in a way that captures the narrative flow of the story. These headers should be written such that they are sufficient that someone reading them could explain your whole project, even though you haven’t written the content yet. Put them in bold.\nAssign the bullet points to headers. These will guide how you flush out the body text.\nWrite the content paragraphs. Don’t worry about writing them in order. If you have trouble making progress on one, write a shabby skeleton the best you can, and move on to a different section. The headers from step 5 will give you a strong sense of which chunks of text are self-contained.\nEdit. Go back to any paragraphs that are not flowing correctly. Use a read-aloud service (ex. MS word) to listen to your draft.\nRealize you’re about 20% over the page limit. Change font to 12pt Times New Roman. Now you’re done.\n\n\nI am writing this in 2021. The specific formatting instructions might have changed since then. Never listen to anyone about presentation standards, except the official instructions.\nSteps 4-6 should only contain sentence fragments and ideas that are easy to write. Do not spend time agonizing over wording in these steps.\n\n\nI learned #6 by reading other people’s Vanier examples. Done correctly, your headers will improve the readability of your documents. This will be the thing that makes your application skimmable. This is important, because your application will be one of a large number of others that reviewers will have to read through.\nAnother critical trick for me is to always draft in Arial before finalizing to Times New Roman. TNR is significantly more condensed, and this font conversion will gift you extra space, as long as you don’t start by writing in it. I tend to over-write, and this trick helps me avoid having to spend a lot of time cutting content.\nWhen it comes to getting the exact wording you want, don’t let perfect be the enemy of progress. When you get stuck on a word:\n\nUse a thesaurus\nLook at other writing samples (some of mine are available here)\nWrite down a few synonyms of the word you’re trying to find as a note to self and come back to it later.\n\n\n\n\nThis is just one structure example, which I have followed with success in the past. There are many other equally effective other structuring approaches.\nThere are a few points in this structure that are subtly distinct. You should not just paraphrase the same sentence twice for these, which is a pitfall I’ve been prone to. These elements have different roles in the proposal. I have highlighted pairs of elements in this structure should not get conflated. Distinguish them from each other by changing the scope of what they describe, or where they fall on a timeline spanning from “your project” to “we aquired all knowledge in the field”.\n\nBackground and motivation\n\nWhere we are now (state of the field)\nWhat’s needed (key steps in new knowledge generation)\n\nObjectives and hypothesis\n\nWhat you’re developing (one liner)\nWhat it will enable (big picture impact of your results)\n\nKnowledge gap (The direction your results will take the field in. Keep it large enough scale/scope that your project does not completely fill this gap, but maybe your project, plus 3-5 years more research would.)\nSignificance (Implications of what your project will enable)\nExperimental and theoretical approach\n\nSummary of 2-3 goals. Goals should describe the overarching themes of what your results will show.\n2-3 aims, with substeps that build to each aim. Aims should be actionable steps you will take, and build on each other logically, however later aims should not strictly rely on the success of earlier aims in order to be possible to execute. (What would you do if the early stuff didn’t work out? You don’t want to leave your proposal vulnerable to that question.)\n\nWhy you are uniquely positioned to execute the research here and now\n\nThe biggest challenge for early-PhDs is not yet having a super strong grasp on the state of their field, and how their project fits in that context. Probably your PI has a good idea of this, and they may have an overarching research story that you can tap into. The only other thing you can do to improve on this is to read widely and engage with other researchers in your field. This is more of a student-lifestyle thing than it is writing advice, but it’s what makes for a good researcher (and subsequently, research proposal).\n\n\n\nIf you’re not already using a citation management tool, then your life is harder than it needs to be. I use Zotero, but many favour Mendeley, or Paperpile.\n\nI explain all the reasons I love Zotero in this post.\n\n\n\n\nAs a serial procrastinator, this is the piece of advice that I always hated hearing. Obviously no one wants to fall into last minute panic, it just happens.\nDon’t expect to nail it on the first try.\nThe easiest thing to work off of is your own past writing samples. You can steal full sentences from them without plagerizing, and it’s always in your own words 😌"

It will also let you have a hand in what your letters look like, and ensure that they suport your personal leadership statement.\n\nBonus tip: I avoid using the phrase “reference letter” because that sounds to me like a neutral term. Your referees should absolutely not be neutral about you! The phrase I prefer is “endorsement letter”. This sounds more positive overall, and is a good way to signal to your referees what you are asking for from them. A reference letter that is not an endorsement is not useful to you anyways."
