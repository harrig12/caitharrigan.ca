I did my undergraduate studies at the University of Toronto, in Computational Biology and Statistics. My thesis work pertains to cancer genomics, and modelling the evolutionary constraints that underlie how mutation events occur in DNA. I’m passionate about open science, and promoting great mentorship in the sciences.\r\nMemberships & Affiliations\r\n\r\n\r\nwhen\r\n\r\n\r\nwhat\r\n\r\n\r\nwhere\r\n\r\n\r\nSep 2020 — present\r\n\r\n\r\nMember\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Temerty Centre for Artificial Intelligence Research and Education in Medicine (T-CAIREM)\r\n\r\n\r\nMay 2020 — present\r\n\r\n\r\nGraduate Student\r\n\r\n\r\nOntario Institute for Cancer Research\r\n\r\n\r\nSep 2019 — present\r\n\r\n\r\nGraduate Student\r\n\r\n\r\nVector Institute, Toronto, Canada\r\n\r\n\r\nJul 2020 — Jul 2022\r\n\r\n\r\nResearch Fellow\r\n\r\n\r\nAssociation for Computing Machinery’s Special Interest Group on High Performance Computing\r\n\r\n\r\nEducation\r\n\r\n\r\nwhen\r\n\r\n\r\nwhat\r\n\r\n\r\nwhere\r\n\r\n\r\nJan 2021 — present\r\n\r\n\r\nPhD in Computer Science, supervised by Quaid Morris and Kieran Campbell\r\n\r\n\r\nUniversity of Toronto\r\n\r\n\r\nSep 2019 — Mar 2021\r\n\r\n\r\nMSc in Computer Science, supervised by Quaid Morris\r\n\r\n\r\nUniversity of Toronto\r\n\r\n\r\nSep 2015 — Jun 2019\r\n\r\n\r\nHonours BSc. in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology\r\n\r\n\r\nUniversity of Toronto\r\n\r\n\r\nWork experience\r\n\r\n\r\nwhen\r\n\r\n\r\nwhat\r\n\r\n\r\nwhere\r\n\r\n\r\nMay 2021 — Sep 2021\r\n\r\n\r\nGraduate Research Assisstant\r\n\r\n\r\nMemorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center\r\n\r\n\r\nSep 2018 — May 2019\r\n\r\n\r\nUndergraduate Research Assistant\r\n\r\n\r\nTerrence Donnelly Centre for Cellular and Biomolecular Genetics\r\n\r\n\r\nMay 2017 — Sep 2017\r\n\r\n\r\nUndergraduate Research Assistant\r\n\r\n\r\nSickKids The Hospital for Sick Children\r\n\r\n\r\nMay 2016 — Sep 2016\r\n\r\n\r\nIntern\r\n\r\n\r\nEviviz\r\n\r\n\r\nPublications\r\n\r\n\r\nx\r\n\r\n\r\nCaitlin F Harrigan, Gabriella Morgenshtern, Anna Goldenberg, and Fanny Chevalier.
