    "text": "This article got posted in my lab’s slack. It claims the folowing:\n\nConventional wisdom in the laboratory sciences suggests that PhD students develop their research skills as a function of mentorship from their faculty advisors (i.e., principal investigators; PIs). However, no prior research has identified empirically a relationship between specific PI practices and the development of research skills. Here we show that PIs’ laboratory and mentoring activities do not significantly predict students’ skill development trajectories, but the engagement of postdocs and senior graduate students in laboratory interactions do. These findings support the practice of “cascading mentorship” as differentially effective and identify a critical but previously unrecognized role for postdocs in the graduate training process. They also illustrate both the importance and the feasibility of identifying evidence-based practices in graduate education.\n\nA postdoc in my lab responded, with their wisdom:\n\nuse tmux\nuse Snakemake\nuse Pycharm\nuse zsh\ndon’t use Jupyter Notebooks\nuse conda environments\n\nThis list has served me well so far.

She was patient, supportive, and skilled at explaining complicated concepts in biology and programming. As a mentor, she has a great sense of when to guide you through a problem and when to let you work through challenges on your own. She helped me grow as a researcher and writer and I’m grateful for everything I learned from her.”\n\n\n“As a mentor, Caitlin has greatly enhanced my ability to conduct research. She also provided valuable resources and aimed to make sure that I understood the fundamental concepts behind all the research conducted by breaking down difficult principles into easily comprehensible statements and thoughts. Additionally, she helped me find any sources of error as the research progressed. I enjoyed researching under her guidance, and I had an overall positive experience.”"
