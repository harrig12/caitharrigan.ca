I’m a graduate researcher at the Vector Institute and Doctoral Fellow at the UofT Data Sciences Institute. I did my undergraduate studies at the University of Toronto, in Computational Biology and Statistics. I use machine learning to understand cancer genomics by modelling the evolutionary constraints that underlie how mutation events occur in DNA. I’m passionate about open science, and promoting great mentorship in the sciences.\n\nEducation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 2021 — \n\n\n PhD in Computer Science   University of Toronto \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n 2019 — 2021 \n\n\n MSc in Computer Science   University of Toronto \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n 2015 — 2019 \n\n\n Honours BSc.
