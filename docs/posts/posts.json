Since retiring, they‚Äôve taken up their version of bird watching in the backyard: conducting an observational study of the birds in the backyard.\r\nThey‚Äôve set up a bunch of sensors to collect air quality data, weather information, and timelapse images. They‚Äôre monitoring flower visits of all sorts of pollinators, such as bees and humming birds. If all goes well with the infrared camera, maybe even bats.\r\nI‚Äôve been helping them out with some data analysis and visualizations. I‚Äôm putting together a data dashboard, and I set up the Galiwatch website. We‚Äôre collaborating with the folks at Biodiversity Galiano and IMERSS to make low-cost, hyperlocal ecosystem and climate monitoring accessible for other citizen scientists!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "contents": "\r\nOver the last year, I have been asking various people this question:\r\n\r\nWhat makes for a truly excellent grad student?\r\n\r\nI highly recommend you put this question to the people in your life that you work with, and admire. So far, I‚Äôve recieved thoughtful answers, but the question often seems to takes people by surprise. This is funny to me because it makes me think that although a lot of grad students seem to be concerned with getting feedback on ‚Äúam I doing a good job?‚Äù they aren‚Äôt asking for help on how to do a good job.\r\nObviously you can substitute ‚Äúgrad student‚Äù with whatever your position is. I think this is a valuable question in general for getting perspective on what skills and behaviours you should be investing your time into.\r\nHere are some of my favourite responses from the people I asked:\r\nThey read a lot. They survey the field and have a good understanding of what‚Äôs out there and how their work fits within the context of the research landscape, and how their work is driving the field forward.\r\nThey are someone who focuses on what the big-picture impact of their project is, and thinks about the ultimate results and their significance.\r\nThey are a good communicator. They can write clearly, and they can explain their ideas.\r\nThey know how to make use of their advisor. Often, there are things that an advisor knows a simple answer to, that students don‚Äôt find out about just because they didn‚Äôt ask.\r\nDid you get a good answer to this question? Create an issue if you‚Äôd like to share it, and I‚Äôll add it to my list üåª\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "contents": "\r\nThis article got posted in my lab‚Äôs slack. It claims the folowing:\r\n\r\nConventional wisdom in the laboratory sciences suggests that PhD students develop their research skills as a function of mentorship from their faculty advisors (i.e., principal investigators; PIs). However, no prior research has identified empirically a relationship between specific PI practices and the development of research skills. Here we show that PIs‚Äô laboratory and mentoring activities do not significantly predict students‚Äô skill development trajectories, but the engagement of postdocs and senior graduate students in laboratory interactions do. These findings support the practice of ‚Äúcascading mentorship‚Äù as differentially effective and identify a critical but previously unrecognized role for postdocs in the graduate training process. They also illustrate both the importance and the feasibility of identifying evidence-based practices in graduate education.\r\n\r\nA postdoc in my lab responded, with their wisdom:\r\nuse tmux\r\nuse Snakemake\r\nuse Pycharm\r\nuse zsh\r\ndon‚Äôt use Jupyter Notebooks\r\nuse conda environments\r\nThis list has served me well so far.
