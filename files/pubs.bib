	abstract = {Mutational signatures are patterns of mutation types, many of which are linked to known mutagenic processes. Signature activity represents the proportion of mutations a signature generates. In cancer, cells may gain advantageous phenotypes through mutation accumulation, causing rapid growth of that subpopulation within the tumour. The presence of many subclones can make cancers harder to treat and have other clinical implications. Reconstructing changes in signature activities can give insight into the evolution of cells within a tumour. Recently, we introduced a new method, TrackSig, to detect changes in signature activities across time from single bulk tumour sample. By design, TrackSig is unable to identify mutation populations with different frequencies but little to no difference in signature activity. Here we present an extension of this method, TrackSigFreq, which enables trajectory reconstruction based on both observed density of mutation frequencies and changes in mutational signature activities. TrackSigFreq preserves the advantages of TrackSig, namely optimal and rapid mutation clustering through segmentation, while extending it so that it can identify distinct mutation populations that share similar signature activities.},
