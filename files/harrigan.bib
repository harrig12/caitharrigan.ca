	abstract = {Mutational signatures are patterns of mutation types, many of which are linked to known mutagenic processes. Signature activity represents the proportion of mutations a signature generates. In cancer, cells may gain advantageous phenotypes through mutation accumulation, causing rapid growth of that subpopulation within the tumour. The presence of many subclones can make cancers harder to treat and have other clinical implications. Reconstructing changes in signature activities can give insight into the evolution of cells within a tumour. Recently, we introduced a new method, TrackSig, to detect changes in signature activities across time from single bulk tumour sample. By design, TrackSig is unable to identify mutation populations with different frequencies but little to no difference in signature activity. Here we present an extension of this method, TrackSigFreq, which enables trajectory reconstruction based on both observed density of mutation frequencies and changes in mutational signature activities. TrackSigFreq preserves the advantages of TrackSig, namely optimal and rapid mutation clustering through segmentation, while extending it so that it can identify distinct mutation populations that share similar signature activities.},

	abstract = {Cancer genomes harbor a catalog of somatic mutations. The type and genomic context of these mutations depend on their causes, and allow their attribution to particular mutational signatures. Previous work has shown that mutational signature activities change over the course of tumor development, but investigations of genomic region variability in mutational signatures have been limited. Here, we expand upon this work by constructing regional profiles of mutational signature activities over 2,203 whole genomes across 25 tumor types, using data aggregated by the Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (PCAWG) consortium. We find that 426 genomes from 20 tumor types display at least one change in mutational signature activities (changepoint), and 174 genomes contain a recurrent changepoint shared by three or more genomes of the same tumor type. Twenty-three recurrent changepoint locations are shared by multiple tumor types. Within these regions, the particular signature changes are often consistent across samples of the same type, and some, but not all are characterized by signatures associated with subclonal expansion. The changepoints we found cannot strictly be explained by gene density, mutation density, or cell-of-origin chromatin state. We hypothesize that they reflect a confluence of factors including evolutionary timing of mutational processes, regional differences in somatic mutation rate, large-scale changes in chromatin state that may be tissue type-specific, and changes in chromatin accessibility during subclonal expansion. These results provide insight into the regional effects of DNA damage and repair processes, and may help us localize genomic and epigenomic changes that occur during cancer development.},

	doi = {10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-22-0121},
	abstract = {The mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a key regulator of cell growth that integrates growth factor signaling and nutrient availability and is a downstream effector of oncogenic receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and PI3K/Akt signaling. Thus, activating mTOR mutations would be expected to enhance growth in many tumor types. However, tumor sequencing data has shown that mTOR mutations are enriched only in renal clear cell carcinoma, a clinically hypervascular tumor unlikely to be constrained by nutrient availability. To further define this cancer type-specific restriction, we studied activating mutations in mTOR. All mTOR mutants tested enhanced growth in a cell type agnostic manner under nutrient-replete conditions but were detrimental to cell survival in nutrient-poor conditions. Consistently, analysis of tumor data demonstrated that oncogenic mutations in the nutrient-sensing arm of the mTOR pathway display a similar phenotype and were exceedingly rare in human cancers of all types. Together, these data suggest that maintaining the ability to turn off mTOR signaling in response to changing nutrient availability is retained in most naturally occurring tumors.},
