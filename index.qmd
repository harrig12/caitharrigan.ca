I am a graduate student at the University of Toronto supervised by [Quaid Morris](https://www.morrislab.ca/) and [Kieran Campbell](https://www.camlab.ca/), and a graduate researcher at the [Vector Institute] and [Ontario Institute for Cancer Research](https://oicr.on.ca/). 

I did my undergraduate studies at the University of Toronto, in Computational Biology and Statistics, and in my PhD work I use machine learning to understand cancer evolution. I'm passionate about open science, and promoting great mentorship in the sciences.


I like to drink coffee and go hiking `r emo::ji('coffee')` `r emo::ji('snow_capped_mountain')` `r emo::ji('sun')`
