I am a graduate student at the University of Toronto supervised by [Quaid Morris](https://www.morrislab.ca/) and [Kieran Campbell](https://www.camlab.ca/), and a graduate researcher at the [Vector Institute](https://vectorinstitute.ai/) and [Ontario Institute for Cancer Research](https://oicr.on.ca/). I use machine learning to understand cancer evolution.

I did my undergraduate studies at the University of Toronto, in Computational Biology and Statistics. I'm passionate about open science, and promoting great mentorship in the sciences.

I like to drink coffee and go hiking `r emo::ji('coffee')` `r emo::ji('snow_capped_mountain')` `r emo::ji('sun')`

### Testimonials 


> "I was fortunate to work with Cait for almost a year and had a wonderful experience. She was patient, supportive, and skilled at explaining complicated concepts in biology and programming. As a mentor, she has a great sense of when to guide you through a problem and when to let you work through challenges on your own. She helped me grow as a researcher and writer and Iâ€™m grateful for everything I learned from her."

> "As a mentor, Caitlin has greatly enhanced my ability to conduct research. She also provided valuable resources and aimed to make sure that I understood the fundamental concepts behind all the research conducted by breaking down difficult principles into easily comprehensible statements and thoughts. Additionally, she helped me find any sources of error as the research progressed. I enjoyed researching under her guidance, and I had an overall positive experience."
